If an agent hasn't started after 20 seconds (ie there are no keep alives) set the state to dead.

Have an top like tool. Send the agent state to a queue so that anything can attach to the queue
and do with it what it will. If this is done on a topic queue with fanout then a tool would be
able to get the state of every agent in the network. Obviously if nothing is listening on the
queue then no messages would be sent.
