If an agent hasn't started after 20 seconds (ie there are no keep alives)
set the state to dead.

Have an top like tool. Send the agent state to a queue so that anything
can attach to the queue and do with it what it will. If this is done
on a topic queue with fanout then a tool would be able to get the state
of every agent in the network. Obviously if nothing is listening on the
queue then no messages would be sent.

Agents should be namespace-able. The agency and smithctl should understand
this. Agents should be controllable on a namespace basis, e.g. shutdown
all agents in a particular namespace. Consider using vhosts.

Allow an agent to verify that it's the same version as that on disc. Maybe
implement an autoload system. Look at shogun

Think about whether to not send messages to agents if they aren't alive.
At the moment this is a little inconsistent: some command check to see it
the agent is alive and others check to see if there is anything listening
on the queue.

Have an option that shuts down all agents when the agency is closed.

Have a config item where I can put a list of agents that I can then start
(or stop or kill for that matter)all at the same time. For example the
command might be:

  smithctl group start <group name>
  smithctl group stop <group name>
